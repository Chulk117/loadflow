# Low voltage grid load flow analysis with PV systems example

This project shows how to conduct a low load flow analysis of a low voltage grid with 16kWp systems at each home.

Two major selection for "Loadflowwithsolarbasis16.3kWp.slx" model:

- Phasor mode at 50Hz 
- Three phase programmable Voltage source


## Getting Started

To run this demo:
1. Load the and run model in simulink
2. Open the powergui block and select load flow analyser
3. Select update and then compute.
4. The load flow results are generated

## Toolbox Requirements
- MATLAB
- Simulink
- Simscape
- Simscape Electrical
